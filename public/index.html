      manifest.json provides metadata used when your web app is installed on a
      user's mobile device or desktop. See https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      <h2>Senior User Researcher & Designer</h2>
      <p>I lead research & design on Raft's project partnering with the US Department of Health and Human Services. We're redesigning and modernizing TANF¹ Data Reporting tools used by every US state, tribe, and territory.</p>
      <p>Before my move to the world of GovTech, I spent three years working with early-stage b2b startups in hybrid UX & Product Management roles. I built user research practices from the ground up, led cross-functional teams in data-backed decision making, and aimed strategy at positive outcomes—not just outputs.</p>
